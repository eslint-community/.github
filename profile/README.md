## A home for high-value projects in the ESLint ecosystem.

As you can read in the
["`eslint-community` GitHub organization" RFC](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs/tree/main/designs/2022-community-eslint-org),
the goal of this organization is to have a place where community members can
help ensure widely depended upon ESLint-related packages live and never fall out
of maintenance.

The Community Core team (which currently consists of
[`@aladdin-add`](https://github.com/aladdin-add),
[`@MichaelDeBoey`](https://github.com/MichaelDeBoey),
[`@ota-meshi`](https://github.com/ota-meshi) and
[`@voxpelli`](https://github.com/voxpelli)) and all package
maintainers will make sure these packages stay up-to-date with newer ESLint
releases, and that they don't hold the wider community back by relying on any single one
person's GitHub or npm account.
